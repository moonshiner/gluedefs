   Glue records:  "...[Resource records] which are not part of the
      authoritative data [of the zone], and are address RRs for the
      [name] servers [in subzones].  These RRs are only necessary if the
      name server's name is 'below' the cut, and are only used as part
      of a referral response."  Without glue "we could be faced with the
      situation where the NS RRs tell us that in order to learn a name
      server's address, we should contact the server using the address
      we wish to learn."  (Quoted from [RFC1034], Section 4.2.1)

      A later definition is that glue "includes any record in a zone
      file that is not properly part of that zone, including nameserver
      records of delegated sub-zones (NS records), address records that
      accompany those NS records (A, AAAA, etc), and any other stray
      data that might appear."  (Quoted from [RFC2181], Section 5.4.1)

      Although glue is sometimes used today with this wider definition
      in mind, the context surrounding the definition in [RFC2181]
      suggests it is intended to apply to the use of glue within the
      document itself and not necessarily beyond.

   In-domain Glue: a modifier to describe a name server whose name is
         either subordinate to or (rarely) the same as the owner name of
         the NS resource records.  An in-domain name server name needs
         to have glue records or name resolution fails.  For example, a
         delegation for "child.example.com" may have "in-domain" name
         server name "ns.child.example.com".

   Sibling domain Glue: a name server's name that is either subordinate
         to or (rarely) the same as the zone origin and not subordinate
         to or the same as the owner name of the NS resource records.
         Glue records for sibling domains are allowed, but not
         necessary.  For example, a delegation for "child.example.com"
         in "example.com" zone may have "sibling" name server name
         "ns.another.example.com".

   The following table shows examples of delegation types.

   Delegation |Parent|Name Server Name  | Type            | "Include Glue"
   -----------+------+------------------+-----------------+-----------
   com        | .    |a.gtld-servers.net| sibling domain  | should
   net        | .    |a.gtld-servers.net| in-domain       | could
   example.org| org  |ns.example.org    | in-domain       | could
   example.org| org  |ns.ietf.org       | sibling domain  | could
   example.org| org  |ns.example.com    | neither         | should not
   example.jp | jp   |ns.example.jp     | in-domain       | should
   example.jp | jp   |ns.example.ne.jp  | sibling domain  | could
   example.jp | jp   |ns.example.com    | neither         | should not

   Bailiwick:  "In-bailiwick" and "Out-of-bailiwick" are modifiers used
      to describe the relationship between a zone and the name servers
      for that zone.  The dictionary definition of bailiwick has been
      observed to cause more confusion than meaning for this use.
      These terms should be considered historic in nature.
