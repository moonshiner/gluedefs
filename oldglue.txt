   Glue records:  "...[Resource records] which are not part of the
      authoritative data [of the zone], and are address RRs for the
      [name] servers [in subzones].  These RRs are only necessary if the
      name server's name is 'below' the cut, and are only used as part
      of a referral response."  Without glue "we could be faced with the
      situation where the NS RRs tell us that in order to learn a name
      server's address, we should contact the server using the address
      we wish to learn."  (Quoted from [RFC1034], Section 4.2.1)

      A later definition is that glue "includes any record in a zone
      file that is not properly part of that zone, including nameserver
      records of delegated sub-zones (NS records), address records that
      accompany those NS records (A, AAAA, etc), and any other stray
      data that might appear."  (Quoted from [RFC2181], Section 5.4.1)

      Although glue is sometimes used today with this wider definition
      in mind, the context surrounding the definition in [RFC2181]
      suggests it is intended to apply to the use of glue within the
      document itself and not necessarily beyond.

   Bailiwick:  "In-bailiwick" is a modifier to describe a name server
      whose name is either a subdomain of or (rarely) the same as the
      origin of the zone that contains the delegation to the name
      server.  In-bailiwick name servers may have glue records in their
      parent zone (using the first of the definitions of "glue records"
      in the definition above).  (The word "bailiwick" means the
      district or territory where a bailiff or policeman has
      jurisdiction.)

      "In-bailiwick" names are divided into two types of names for name
      servers: "in-domain" names and "sibling domain" names.

      *  In-domain: a modifier to describe a name server whose name is
         either subordinate to or (rarely) the same as the owner name of
         the NS resource records.  An in-domain name server name needs
         to have glue records or name resolution fails.  For example, a
         delegation for "child.example.com" may have "in-domain" name
         server name "ns.child.example.com".

      *  Sibling domain: a name server's name that is either subordinate
         to or (rarely) the same as the zone origin and not subordinate
         to or the same as the owner name of the NS resource records.
         Glue records for sibling domains are allowed, but not
         necessary.  For example, a delegation for "child.example.com"
         in "example.com" zone may have "sibling" name server name
         "ns.another.example.com".

      "Out-of-bailiwick" is the antonym of "in-bailiwick".  It is a
      modifier to describe a name server whose name is not subordinate
      to or the same as the zone origin.  Glue records for out-of-
      bailiwick name servers are useless.  The following table shows
      examples of delegation types.
